# **Project 1 - should Eniac merge with Magist?**

Hello everyone and welcome to have a look at my **${\color{green}Project 1}$**, in which my team and I researched and carefully analysed data extracted from Brazilian company **Magist**.
Our task was to provide the tech giant Eniac with a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of collaborating with Magist.
Our objective was to research the Brazilian market and determine whether Magist would be a suitable partner for the extensive distribution of Apple products. 
Our approach required a deep dive into data, critical analysis of business questions, and formulating recommendations that would offer the most strategic advantage to Eniac's CEO. 

To provide a thorough recommendation on whether Eniac should partner with Magist for selling Apple products in Brazil, we need to consider several key factors:
1. **Demand for Apple Products**
2. **Sales Performance**, particularly focusing on their performance with Apple products.
3. **Reputation**, including customer reviews and brand perception.
4. **Generated yearly revenue**, to ensure they can sustain a long-term partnership.

## How did we obtain and present the data?
To achieve this, we had to explore the data using **SQL** queries and presented our findings visually using **Tableau** and **Google Presentations**.
